# Activity Scorecard Lightning Web Component  

This is a configurable component to summarize a users key activities and KPIs on the home page. This is a demo component only and does not contain any logic for fetching the activity counts.

Once Installed you can drag onto any lightning page. In app builder there are a set of configurable options to set this up to work for whatever you are demoing, the defaults are meant to work for a standard sales/inside sales user but you could change this to work for a Support Agent or really any other role.

A couple of configuration notes:

* You can switch the KPIs between positive and negative via the “KPI 1 Positive?” and “KPI 2 Positive?” check boxes, all this does is toggle the number color.
* You can change the Iconsfor each activity type. To change the icon simply pick the icon you would like to use here: https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/ and use the “iconcategory:name” naming convention i.e. standard:case or custom:custom63. 
* When the number of activities completed is greater than the personal best the bottom text will change to “New Personal Best” and become bold.
